# Dtube Mobile Login Help
## Username
Enter your username into the username input box. It is not necessary to use the @ symbol before your name.
## Password (Posting Key)
Now you need to use your Steemit posting key as the password. This is different than your master password to login to Steemit. Follow the instructions below to get your Steemit posting key.

 1. Login on steemit.com
 2. Click on your user icon in the top right of the page and select "Change Password"
 3. Click on the "Permissions" sub-tab
 4. MOST IMPORTANTLY from within the permissions page on steemit where you see all your keys, YOU MUST press the green button on the right side of the posting key that says "show private key". If you do not do this the key shown will just be a placeholder and even the qr code image will be fake.
 5. Now you can either copy and paste the posting key, or press on the QR code icon and use the QR scanner on the app to login.
